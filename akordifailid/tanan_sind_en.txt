[Salm 1]
C#
Wandering into the night
C#
Wanting a place to hide
            F#
This weary soul,
             C#
this bag of bones
C#
And I tried with all my might
C#
But I just can't win the fight
              F#
I'm slowly drifting
          C#
a vagabond

[Eelrefrään]
    G#              A#m
And just when I ran out of road
   F#              C#
I met a man I didn't know
G#                A#m           F#
And He told me that I was not alone

[Refrään]
C#               D#m
He picked me up, turned me around
C#               F#
Placed my feet on solid ground
            A#m                  F#
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior!
          C#                D#m
Because He healed my heart, He changed my name
     C#            F#
Forever free, I'm not the same
            A#m                  F#
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
        C#
I thank God

[Salm 2]
C#
I cannot dеny what I see
C#
Got no choice but to believе
F#
My doubts are burning
               C#
Like ashes in the wind
C#
So, so long to my old friends
C#
Burden and bitterness
              F#
You can just keep it moving
                   C#
Nah, you ain't welcome here

[Eelrefrään]
G#                  A#m
From now till I walk the streets of gold
   F#           C#
I'll sing of how you saved my soul
    G#               A#m           F#
This wayward son has found his way back home

[Refrään]
C#               D#m
He picked me up, turned me around
C#               F#
Placed my feet on solid ground
            A#m                  F#
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
          C#                D#m
Because He healed my heart, He changed my name
     C#            F#
Forever free, I'm not the same
            A#m                  D#m
I thank the Master, I thank the Savior
        C#
I thank God
